## *Conflicts Resolved*

### *Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)*

#### *Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml*
- *Issue:* Production used port 8080, development used 3000  
- *Resolution:* Created unified config with environment-based settings  
- *Strategy:* Keep production as default, add dev as optional  
- *Difficulty:* Medium  
- *Time:* 15 minutes  

#### *Conflict 2: config/database-config.json*
- *Issue:* Different database hosts and SSL modes  
- *Resolution:* Created separate profiles for production and development  
- *Strategy:* Restructured JSON to support both environments  
- *Difficulty:* Medium  
- *Time:* 10 minutes  

#### *Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh*
- *Issue:* Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)  
- *Resolution:* Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable  
- *Strategy:* Made script handle both environments dynamically  
- *Difficulty:* Hard  
- *Time:* 20 minutes  

#### *Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js*
- *Issue:* Different monitoring intervals and log formats  
- *Resolution:* Environment-based configuration object  
- *Strategy:* Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior  
- *Difficulty:* Medium  
- *Time:* 15 minutes  

#### *Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md*
- *Issue:* Different architectural descriptions  
- *Resolution:* Merged both descriptions into a comprehensive document  
- *Strategy:* Created sections for each environment  
- *Difficulty:* Easy  
- *Time:* 10 minutes  

#### *Conflict 6: README.md*
- *Issue:* Different feature lists and version numbers  
- *Resolution:* Combined all features with clear environment labels  
- *Strategy:* Organized features by category  
- *Difficulty:* Easy  
- *Time:* 10 minutes  


### *Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)*

#### *Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml*
- *Issue:* Staging vs production differences  
- *Resolution:* Introduced staging configuration block  
- *Strategy:* Unified configuration for all environments  
- *Difficulty:* Medium  
- *Time:* 15 minutes  

#### *Conflict 2: config/database-config.json*
- *Issue:* Mismatch in database credentials and drivers  
- *Resolution:* Added environment-based credential system  
- *Strategy:* Configured flexible JSON structure  
- *Difficulty:* Medium  
- *Time:* 10 minutes  

#### *Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh*
- *Issue:* Manual deployment vs automated pipeline  
- *Resolution:* Merged into single automated script with both options  
- *Strategy:* Added argument-based deployment mode  
- *Difficulty:* Hard  
- *Time:* 20 minutes  

#### *Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js*
- *Issue:* One branch used Mocha, other used Jest  
- *Resolution:* Created support for both test frameworks  
- *Strategy:* Conditional logic based on config  
- *Difficulty:* Medium  
- *Time:* 15 minutes  

#### *Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md*
- *Issue:* Extra diagrams and out-of-date sections  
- *Resolution:* Combined latest diagrams and corrected content  
- *Strategy:* Included both visual and text improvements  
- *Difficulty:* Easy  
- *Time:* 10 minutes  

#### *Conflict 6: README.md*
- *Issue:* Missing simulator setup instructions  
- *Resolution:* Added proper setup guide and version info  
- *Strategy:* Finalized unified README  
- *Difficulty:* Easy  
- *Time:* 10 minutes  

## *Testing*

After completing all merge conflict resolutions, the functionality of the application was tested to ensure stability and correctness.

Commands Used to Test

set NODE_ENV=development

npm install

npm run dev

During the testing phase (npm run dev), I faced conflicts due to experimental dependencies and environment setup issues.
Some features required additional configuration to ensure compatibility after merging multiple branches.
Resolving merge conflicts while maintaining the applicationâ€™s functionality was the most challenging part, as it required careful inspection of every conflicting line before committing the final version.

## *Most Challenging Parts*

1. *Understanding Conflict Markers* â€” Initially confused by <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>.  
   Learned that HEAD refers to the current branch and the other side is the incoming change.  

2. *Deciding What to Keep* â€” Choosing between two valid code versions was tricky.  
   I learned to read and understand both before merging.  

3. *Complex Logic Conflicts* â€” Especially in deploy.sh, where both sides had unique logic.  
   I needed to analyze both workflows before merging them safely.  

4. *Testing After Resolution* â€” Ensuring the code still ran correctly after resolving conflicts.  


## *Key Learnings*

### *Technical Skills*
- Mastered conflict resolution process  
- Understood merge conflict markers  
- Learned to use git diff effectively  
- Practiced all major Git commands  

### *Best Practices*
- Always read both sides before resolving  
- Test all resolved files before committing  
- Write clear, meaningful commit messages  
- Use git status frequently  
- Keep commits small and focused  

### *Git Workflow Insights*
- Conflicts are normal, not errors  
- Understand both code versions before deciding  
- Document resolution steps clearly  
- Use git reflog to recover safely  
- Stay calm and consistent  


## *Reflection*
This challenge taught me that *merge conflicts are not mistakes*, but opportunities to better understand the code and team workflow.  
I learned how to calmly analyze, merge, and verify changes.  

Through hands-on practice, I mastered essential Git commands â€” from merge, rebase, and cherry-pick to stash and reset.  
Now, I can confidently manage any Git conflict in real-world development.  

Most importantly, I discovered that **git reflog is a true lifesaver** for recovering lost work! ðŸš€  
This experience has strengthened my confidence as a future software engineer.
